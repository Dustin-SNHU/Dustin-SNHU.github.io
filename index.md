## Self-Assessment
As a Computer Science student, I found myself working on many different types of projects and solving problems that I would not normally have. My final capstone course was no exception as I chose to showcase the skills I developed throughout several different courses. Application development had always been something that fascinated me, but I did not realize that I had the capacity to create something new from scratch until I challenged myself in this final course. When presented with the choice of a way to showcase my skills in computer science, I reviewed past terms and found that the skills I gained in IT-390: Mobile App Design and Development prepared me most adequately for this opportunity.
In this course, I developed a mobile application that replicated a task list that could run on an Android phone. While I did not create the entire application from scratch, there were many problem-solving techniques that I needed to use to finish the final product. The capstone course requirements tasked me with creating one or more artifacts that displayed my skills in three key areas. These areas were software design and engineering, algorithm and data structures, and database. Enhancing this Android application would allow me to fulfill all these requirements while also pushing me to learn what it takes to build a mobile application from the ground up. 
My accomplishments for this course and how they apply to each requirement are as follows:

- Design and Engineering
	- Creating a new application that can be used in a professional environment.
	- Using Xcode to develop the program in a new system.
	- Learning SwiftUI to code the application. This language was unknown to be prior to starting the course.

- Algorithm and Data Structures
	- Creating an application from scratch using coding best practices.
	- Using functions, variables, and data structures properly.
	- Using proper syntax to develop code with appropriate comments within the source code.

- Database
	- Allowing saving local data on a mobile device.
	- Allowing data retrieval after the application is closed and re-opened.
	- Array organization so that CRUD (create, read update, and delete) operations can be performed against the local database.

To demonstrate my understanding of Computer Science, I chose to create a new application for use on iOS devices. The purpose of this application is to allow a user to perform CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) functions on a task list. This application was created in Xcode using the Swift programming language. This platform and language were primarily chosen because it gave me an opportunity to learn a new skill while showcasing my understanding of software development.

The following sections will provide examples of my jounrey in creating this application and design decisions that lead to the final product.

#### Algorithm and Data Structures


#### Database
