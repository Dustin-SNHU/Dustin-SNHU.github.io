## Enhanced Artifact: [TooDoo2 Repository](https://github.com/Dustin-SNHU/TooDoo2)<br>

### Description
An enhanced version of the original list making application I created as part of IT-390. Written in Swift with Xcode, this application was developed for an iOS device. Primarily as a way to test my skills by learning a new language, I chose iOS because it is my preferred mobile operating system and used by millions of others.
