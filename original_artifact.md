## Original Artifact: [Android Task Repository](https://github.com/Dustin-SNHU/AndroidTask)<br>

### Description
The original artifact used as the starting point for my capstone enhancement project. This project was originally created solely in Android Studio and not uploaded to GitHub until the project was completed.

### Overview
This task list application is a proof-of-concept application that I developed for a previous course at SNHU. The primary purpose of this application is to show my development skills with application development by utilizing data structures, UI (user interface) components, and database creation and manipulation. Using the Android platform, a user of this application can add items to a list of things that they need to do. They can then perform CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations on an array database that is saved to the local device they are working on.

### Reflection
The [code review](https://dustin-snhu.github.io/code_review) I conducted in Module 2 of my capstone course at SNHU revealed a lot of shortfalls within my work. The primary issue I found with the original application was the lack of commenting and documentation throughout the source code. Without these critical elements, it would be very difficult for myself or another developer to troubleshoot or enhance this application. Another shortfall that I found was the existence of duplicate code. Marking an item complete and deleting a task used the exact same function. Reducing the number of lines of code in an application makes it more efficient and easier to enhance.

Another major element I wanted to iterate on was the UI of the application and make it more appealing to navigate through.

The above figure is the final project that I submitted for IT-390. It served its purpose as being a fully functional application, but it lacked the appeal that an application on an app store should have. In addition to wanting to learn how to develop for an iOS device, I also wanted my enhanced product to look more professional.

The final enhancement I wanted to use to showcase my database modification skills was to enable the ability to add optional data and an additional date field. Both of these functions were developed in the [Enhanced Artifact](https://dustin-snhu.github.io/enhanced_artifact). Having the ability to store different types of data within a local database is beneficial for applications that need to retain data. Creating a database on a new platform would also showcase my general knowledge for local storage on different platforms.
