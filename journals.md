## Journals

To demonstrate my understanding of Computer Science, I chose to create a new application for use on iOS devices. The purpose of this application is to allow a user to perform CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) functions on a task list. This application was created in Xcode using the Swift programming language. This platform and language were primarily chosen because it gave me an opportunity to learn a new skill while showcasing my understanding of software development.

The following journals will provide written exmples of my journey in creating this application and design decisions that lead to the final product.
